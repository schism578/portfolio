            <p>I am a graduate of Thinkful's Full Stack Engineering FLEX program. I pride myself on the persistence
                it took to complete this arduous program and the larger awareness I've gained in web development
                by virtue of learning how to design and implement protocols in creating full stack web apps. By 
                instituting thorough methods in designing web apps, I've gained an advantage over potential
                complications and, instead, granted myself freedom through having contingency plans in place. React 
                makes programming easy in its modularity and compartmentalization of function and feature. I am 
                innately organized but also enjoy employing creativity upon the machinery of my apps.

            I'm a recreation seeker in the wide outdoor world. Mountains, oceans, cycling, kayaking, boomeranging, 
            skiing, and outdoor live entertainment are all adventures I pursue. Having moved to North Carolina from 
            Illinois last year, my access to nature has been restored. I was raised by artists. My father a painter
            and my mother classically trained in piano and opera, I have an affinity for fine art of all kinds.
            As my practice in web development has overlapped into my personal life, I see many more possibilities
            in implementing it in my personal endeavors. I hope to bind my passions, personal and professional, 
            together in the future.
