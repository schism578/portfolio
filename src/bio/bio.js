            <p>I have always found myself toiling in pursuits of the meticulous. My father, an artist of hundreds
                of miniature paintings, led me to see empiricism in everything - how the galactic is explained or evidenced
                by the microscopic, the universe represented in an atom. Such as I feel like a single cell within the 
                organism of the world, I have proven my capacity to achieve successes at challenges that felt much larger 
                than myself at their outset. Graduating from Thinkful's Full Stack Engineering program, I pushed out 
                every wall, developing a curiousity about the inner and atomic workings of our technologies, and amassing 
                problem-solving methods that translate programming languages into digital realities.

                I spent many years of my life in various stages of education. I have always been pursuant of a higher 
                comprehension of everything that has drawn my attention. Fine art and the sciences of all specialties 
                captivated me through my collegiate studies. But how could I meld them all into one greater skill? I wanted 
                to combine them and apply all of the tact and mental coordination I had gained over those years "learning to 
                learn." I had an epiphany, looking at the technology that surrounded me and the world all around me imagining 
                the trillions of possibilities and directions I could pursue in bridging them and obtaining a profession 
                completely designed around my prowess and intent.
