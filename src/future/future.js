            <p>Getting into web development was both a big shift and a happy accident—one of those moments where 
            everything just kind of clicked, and it felt like the path had been forming all along without me 
            fully realizing it. The skills I've picked up over the years somehow landed me right where I need 
            to be, at the right time, ready to take on something new.</p>
            <p>Right now, I'm in that exciting (and slightly messy) stage of soaking up new ideas, figuring out 
            what great work looks like to me, and slowly putting the pieces together. Some things click right 
            away, others take a few tries—but that's part of the process. I've learned to stay flexible, keep a
            n open mind, and accept that growth often means letting go of what worked yesterday to make room for 
            what works better today.</p>
