            <p>My pursuit of a profession in web development is something of a paradigm shift
                and also a serendipitous realization I had, as though I had been preparing for this all of my life.
                All of the skills and traits I've accumulated over the years have put me in this strategic place at this
                particular time and the pieces and places were all aligned right at the moment I was ready to make my
                commitment to a new future.

                While I have fallen in love with front end web development, I made a realization, or more accurately a 
                self-actualization, that my true professional intention lies in 3D artistry and its application within 
                video game programming and movie production. I dream in the building of stories and have a critical 
                and passionate desire to take my apprentice-level comprehension of web development technologies and leverage 
                it to become a creator of people, places, and things within elaborately imagined worlds and universes.
